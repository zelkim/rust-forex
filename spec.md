# Currency Exchange Application written in rust
This is an application created in compliance to MCO1 for my DLSU CSADPRG class during the first term of A.Y. 2025-2026.

I am about to over-engineer this, not because i want to impress but also as a challenge to myself to get the hang of this language.
